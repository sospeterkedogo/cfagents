## Nested AGENTS.md files

Some directories have their own AGENTS.md with deeper guidance:

| File                        | Scope                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/agents/AGENTS.md` | Core SDK internals — exports, source layout, build, testing, architecture |
| `examples/AGENTS.md`        | Example conventions — required structure, consistency rules, known issues |
| `guides/AGENTS.md`          | Guide conventions — how guides differ from examples, README expectations  |
| `docs/AGENTS.md`            | Writing user-facing docs — Diátaxis framework, upstream sync, style       |
| `design/AGENTS.md`          | Design records and RFCs — format, workflow, relationship to docs          |

## Setup

```bash
npm install        # installs all workspaces; postinstall runs patch-package + playwright
```

Node 24+ required. Uses npm workspaces with [Nx](https://nx.dev) for task orchestration, caching, and affected detection.

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

| Command                      | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build`              | Builds all packages via Nx (cached, dependency-ordered)            |
| `npm run check`              | Full CI check: sherif + export checks + oxfmt + oxlint + typecheck |
| `npm run test`               | Runs all tests via Nx (cached)                                     |
| `npm run test:react`         | Runs Playwright-based React hook tests for agents                  |
| `npm run typecheck`          | TypeScript type checking across the repo (custom script)           |
| `npm run format`             | Oxfmt format all files                                             |
| `npm run check:exports`      | Verifies package.json exports match actual build output            |
| `npx nx affected -t build`   | Build only packages affected by current changes                    |
| `npx nx affected -t test`    | Test only packages affected by current changes                     |
| `npx nx run <project>:build` | Build a single project (and its dependencies)                      |

Run an example locally:

```bash
cd examples/playground   # or any example
npm run dev              # starts Vite dev server + Workers runtime via @cloudflare/vite-plugin
```

Example apps will normally hot reload when the dev server is running. When the dev server is running, make sure to rebuild changed packages (`npm run build`) to see changes reflected in the running app.

## Code standards

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled (`agents/tsconfig`)
- Target: ES2021, module: ES2022, moduleResolution: bundler
- `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` — use explicit `import type` for type-only imports
- JSX: `react-jsx`

### Linting — Oxlint

Config in `.oxlintrc.json`. Plugins: `react`, `jsx-a11y`, `typescript`, `react-hooks`. Key rules:

- `no-explicit-any: "error"` — never use `any`, use `unknown` and narrow
- `no-unused-vars: "error"` — with `varsIgnorePattern: "^_"` and `argsIgnorePattern: "^_"`
- `correctness` category set to `"error"` — catches common mistakes
- `jsx-a11y` rules enabled — accessibility violations are errors
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: "warn"` — warns on missing hook dependencies

Oxlint does **not** handle formatting — Oxfmt does.

### Formatting — Oxfmt

- Run `npm run format` or rely on lint-staged (auto-formats on commit via husky)
- Config in `.oxfmtrc.json` (`trailingComma: "none"`, `printWidth: 80`)

### Workers conventions

- Always TypeScript, always ES modules
- `wrangler.jsonc` (not `.toml`) for configuration
- All wrangler configs use `compatibility_date: "2026-01-28"` and `compatibility_flags: ["nodejs_compat"]`
- Never hardcode secrets — use `wrangler secret put` or `.env`
- No native/FFI dependencies (must run in Workers runtime)

## Testing

Tests use **vitest** with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` for running inside the Workers runtime.

```bash
npm run test              # agents + ai-chat unit/integration tests
npm run test:react        # Playwright-based React hook tests (agents package)
```

Test locations:

- `packages/agents/src/tests/` — core SDK tests
- `packages/agents/src/react-tests/` — React hook tests (Playwright + vitest-browser-react)
- `packages/ai-chat/src/tests/` — AI chat tests
- `packages/agents/src/tests-d/` — type-level tests (`.test-d.ts`)

Each test directory has its own `vitest.config.ts` and (for Workers tests) a `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Contributing

### Changesets

Changes to `packages/` that affect the public API or fix bugs need a changeset:

```bash
npx changeset             # interactive prompt — pick packages, semver bump, description
```

This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` that gets consumed during release.

Examples, guides, and sites don't need changesets.

### Pull request process

CI runs on every PR (`npm ci && npm run build && npm run check && npx nx affected -t test`); the workflow is in `.github/workflows/pullrequest.yml`. On push to `main` the Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs the same steps but uses `nx run-many -t test` as a safety net against under-reported affected projects, then publishes via changesets. All checks must pass.

### Generated files

- `env.d.ts` files are generated by `wrangler types` — regenerate with `npx wrangler types` inside the relevant example/package, don't hand-edit
- `package-lock.json` — regenerated by `npm install`, don't hand-edit

## Learned Workspace Facts

- `packages/shell/` is published as `@cloudflare/shell` — an experimental sandboxed JS execution and filesystem runtime for agents, built on the same dynamic Worker loader machinery as `@cloudflare/codemode`.
- To run code against a `Workspace`: import `stateTools` from `@cloudflare/shell/workers` and `DynamicWorkerExecutor`/`resolveProvider` from `@cloudflare/codemode`; use `executor.execute(code, [resolveProvider(stateTools(workspace))])`.

## Learned User Preferences

- Keep `Workspace` as a pure durable filesystem — do not embed execution or session logic inside it. Execution is a caller concern wired via `@cloudflare/codemode` + `stateTools`.
- When a package boundary feels wrong (e.g., a helper package depending on a larger package just for an adapter), prefer moving the adapter out rather than carrying the dependency.

## Boundaries

**Always:**

- Run `npm run check` before considering work done
- Use `import type` for type-only imports (enforced by `verbatimModuleSyntax`)
- Keep examples simple and self-contained — they're user-facing learning material
- Use Cloudflare Workers APIs (KV, D1, R2, Durable Objects, etc.) over third-party equivalents
- Use Workers AI for LLM calls in examples — not third-party APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic

**Ask first:**

- Adding new dependencies to `packages/` (these ship to users)
- Changing `wrangler.jsonc` compatibility dates across the repo
- Modifying CI workflows

**Never:**

- Hardcode secrets or API keys
- Add native/FFI/C-binding dependencies
- Use `any` — Oxlint will reject it
- Use CommonJS or Service Worker format — ES modules only
- Modify `node_modules/` or `dist/` directories
- Force push to main

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Node.js version

This repo requires **Node 24+** (CI uses Node 24). Cloud Agent VMs ship Node 22 at `/exec-daemon/node`, which takes precedence over nvm unless you prepend nvm’s Node 24 bin directory to `PATH`. A one-time shell setup is already applied in `~/.bashrc` on this VM; in new shells, confirm with `node --version` (should report v24.x).

### Dependency refresh

Run `npm install` from the repo root (see **Setup** above). `postinstall` runs `patch-package`; `prepare` sets up husky.

### Build before running examples

Examples import built package `dist/` output. After pulling changes that touch `packages/`, run `npm run build` before `npm start` in an example. While a dev server is running, rebuild changed packages to pick up SDK changes.

### Playwright (browser / React hook tests)

`agents:test` includes browser tests that need Chromium. One-time setup on a fresh VM:

```bash
npm run prepare:playwright
```

Without this, vitest may pass worker tests but fail during browser teardown with “Executable doesn't exist” for Playwright.

### Running the main playground

```bash
cd examples/playground && npm start   # http://localhost:5173
```

`examples/playground/wrangler.jsonc` sets `"ai": { "remote": true }`, so startup waits on a **remote Workers AI** connection. Without `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (or `wrangler login`), dev may hang at “Establishing remote connection…”. AI chat/voice demos need those credentials; core DO/state demos do not once the server is up.

### Local example without Cloudflare credentials

For a full-stack demo that starts immediately (no remote AI binding):

```bash
cd examples/tictactoe && npm start   # http://localhost:5173
```

Uses local workerd + Durable Objects; optional `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` for the AI opponent move.

### Long-running dev servers

Use tmux for Vite + worker dev servers, e.g. session `tictactoe-dev-server` or `playground-dev-server`. Reattach with `tmux -f /exec-daemon/tmux.portal.conf attach -t <session>`.

### Standard commands

Lint/typecheck/exports: `npm run check`. Tests: `npm run test` or `npx nx run <project>:test`. See the **Commands** table above for the full list.
